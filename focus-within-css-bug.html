    <h1>focus-within Bug for suggestions field</h1>
    <p>
      Here we have a component which has different behavior based on the browser which is
      being used. The component shows a list of possible search options which pops open
      when the user <em>focuses</em> the input field. This list of search options which
      contains links, and the goal is the user could select one of the links that is
      shown (see <a href="https://github.com/innoq/simplete">simplete</a> for more context).
    </p>
    <p>
      The component uses
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within">focus-within</a>
      to implement this behavior.
      <em>However</em>, this is doesn't work in Safari.
      My guess is that Safari doesn't recognize the `.suggestions` dropdown as being part of
      the <code>form</code> element, so when you try to select an element from within the list,
      you end up triggering the focus out event which just hides the dropdown before you are
      actually able to click on the link in the dropdown.
    </p>
    <ul class="indicator">
      <li id="1">Selection 1</li>
      <li id="2">Selection 2</li>
      <li id="3">Selection 3</li>
    </ul>
    <form>
      <label for="search">Search</label>
      <input id="search" type="search">
      <div class="suggestions suggestions--buggy">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#1">Selection 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#2">Selection 2</a></li>
          <li><a href="#3">Selection 3</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </form>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Here is one solution which uses <code>opacity: 0;</code> to hide the dropdown field,
      and then uses a <code>transition</code> on the <code>max-height</code> property with
      a <code>overflow: hidden;</code> rule to also make the elements no longer clickable
      (because they will no longer have a height). But because it is a <em>transition</em>,
      the height is not modified immediately, so there is still time in Safari to click on
      the element before it "disappears" thanks to the change in the `focus-within` rule.
    </p>
    <h3>CSS Snippet for Solution</h3>
<pre><code>
.suggestions--fixed li {
  transition: max-height 1s ease;
  max-height: 100vh;
}
form:not(:focus-within) .suggestions--fixed {
  opacity: 0;
}
form:not(:focus-within) .suggestions--fixed li {
  overflow: hidden;
  max-height: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
    <ul class="indicator">
      <li id="s1">Selection 1</li>
      <li id="s2">Selection 2</li>
      <li id="s3">Selection 3</li>
    </ul>
    <form>
      <label for="search">Search</label>
      <input id="search" type="search">
      <div class="suggestions suggestions--fixed">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#s1">One</a></li>
          <li><a href="#s2">Two</a></li>
          <li><a href="#s3">Three</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </form>
